1727 Topic-Contributed Paper Session 

Oregon Convention Center 

Room: CC-F149 

Based on the success of the Household Pulse Survey, developed and fielded to measure social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau has initiated the Demographic High Frequency Surveys (DHFS) Program. Expanding beyond the current monthly Household Pulse Survey, the Census Bureau is developing the Census Household Panel (CHP) to further understand how a nationally representative, longitudinal survey infrastructure could address limitations in the Household Pulse design and fill similar needs, while also collecting critical data to support the decennial census program, other areas at Census, and eventually other agencies' needs. This is the first nationally-representative panel to be built by a federal statistical agency primarily for federal statistical agency use, and represents a step forward in providing infrastructure for timely data to inform evidence-based decision making across the federal government.  
  
The CHP officially launched in September 2023 with a nationally-representative sample drawn from the Master Address File (MAF), oversampling historically underrepresented tracts. Recruitment consisted of a visible $5 prepaid incentive with the initial survey invitation, followed by a postcard and mailed reminder. Responses were provided primarily via a web instrument, but inbound and outbound phone operations were also available to include respondents who did not have internet capability, or who wished to complete the survey via phone. Outbound phone calls were assigned according to response propensity of the Census tract, with more phone calls being made to tracts with a lower propensity to self-respond according to the American Community Survey.  
  
This session comprises five papers about the CHP specifically and draws connections to other parts of the DHFS, including the Household Pulse. The first paper provides an overview of the methods for the initially recruited CHP sample and the plans for ongoing monthly, or topical, survey data collections. The second paper focuses on the initial sample design for the panel and the success of the recruitment operation to produce a panel with representative characteristics. This paper includes results of initial recruitment mailings and targeted phone operations. The third paper describes plans for refreshment sampling, including the use of the Census Bureau's Demographic Frame. This paper will provide simulated data and discuss different possible replenishment plans. The fourth paper goes beyond the CHP to examine relationships between the data collected using the panel infrastructure to that collected in the Household Pulse and to that collected via a pure opt-in, non-probability panel. This paper looks at implications of different types of measurement on resulting statistics and begins to examine the possibility to triangulate data sources to reduce error. The final paper demonstrates examples of experiments conducted in both the CHP and the Pulse, demonstrating the effectiveness of such tools for quick-turn-around experimentation. The examples provided will focus on measuring race and ethnicity and measuring mental health.  
  
In all, this session will appeal to anyone who relies on high-frequency or panel data collection. This session seeks to provide a transparent lens to innovative data practices in the government.

### [Census Household Panel Sample Design – Using the Auxiliary Data to Stratify the Master Address File](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=2362 "Census Household Panel Sample Design – Using the Auxiliary Data to Stratify the Master Address File")

Research and development work conducted both at the Census Bureau and throughout the field has demonstrated the value of a high-quality panel survey to improve representativeness and significantly reduce burden on households in the interests of collecting high-frequency data. The Census Bureau launched initial recruitment of the Census Household Panel (CHP) for research and development purposes. The initial sample was carefully selected and recruited by the Census Bureau to reflect the diversity of our nation's population. Panel participants were asked to respond to an initial "baseline" questionnaire as well as various monthly survey requests, referred to as "topical collections". This paper outlines the CHP sample design covering the stratification used in selecting the initial sample. We used information form the Census Bureau's demographic frame, a person level frame based on administrative records and the Census Bureau's Planning Database to stratify the housing units on the Master Address File.

### [High Frequency Program Experiments](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=2365 "High Frequency Program Experiments")

One of the goals of Census Household Panel (CHP) is to have more rapid data to provide insight on national events that may affect U.S. households demographically, geographically, socially, or economically. One advantage of having a high-frequency survey that is conducted mostly online is the ability of the program to support quick experiments. Since the CHP is contacting the same households every month, we have the opportunity to ask similar, yet slightly different, content from one month to another as well. This presentation will highlight the experiments from CHP that directly support other current surveys as well as basic research on demographic data collections. For example, using experiments in both the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and in the CHP, we have been investigating different ways to measure social isolation and implications of measuring mental health items early or late in a survey design. Both HPS and CHP have also allowed testing opportunities for other established household surveys. This presentation will highlight findings across these different sets of experiments and set the stage for how the CHP can be used to experimentally test questionnaires in the future.

### [Improving Data Quality Through Panel Refreshment](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=2363 "Improving Data Quality Through Panel Refreshment")

Refreshment sampling is a critical tool for maintaining the quality of panel surveys. Adding new sample protects against a variety of data quality challenges, including bias due to both recruitment response and attrition, panel conditioning effects, and age of panel members. To realize these benefits, survey organizations need sociodemographic characteristics of people or households in order to be able to target refreshment recruitment to achieve an "optimal" mix of panel members. This information may come from commercially purchased panels, screening operations, or response data from other surveys.  
  
The Census Household Panel may conduct refreshment sampling out of the Demographic Frame, which links detailed sociodemographic information from administrative data. This allows for more detailed targeting of refreshment sampling, which could lead to a more representative panel across a broader set of dimensions. This talk demonstrates the impact on various measures of data quality of different replenishment sampling designs. We use a simulated demographic frame, and consider different assumptions about sample sizes, response rates, and nonresponse patterns.

### [Panel or Pulse? Comparing Data Collected across Different Panel and Pulse Methodologies](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=2364 "Panel or Pulse? Comparing Data Collected across Different Panel and Pulse Methodologies")

The Census Household Panel (CHP) is a probability-based online panel under research and development to produce high frequency and longitudinal statistics. The idea of this panel was born out of the success of the experimental Household Pulse Survey (HPS). The HPS is also a probability based online survey but is limited in its contact approaches (email and SMS) and suffers from low response and related non-response bias. In January 2024, the Census Bureau collected the same substantive content in the CHP, the HPS and in a pure opt-in, non-probability panel (the Census Affinity Panel) to examine implications of different types of measurement on resulting statistics. We explore the characteristics of the three data collections, consider options to calibrate the HPS to measures in the CHP, and dimensions where the three sources have more and less consistency. Data quality exists in many dimensions and understanding the relative place for data from these three collection strategies is critical.
