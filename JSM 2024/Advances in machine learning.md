### [A Study of AFib Detection with Machine Learning Algorithms](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3581 "A Study of AFib Detection with Machine Learning Algorithms")

Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is a heart condition that occurs when electrophysiological malformations  
within heart tissues cause the atria to lose coordination with the ventricles, resulting in  
"irregularly irregular" heartbeats. Because symptoms are subtle and unpredictable, AFib diagnosis is  
often difficult or delayed. One possible solution is to build a system which predicts AFib based on the  
variability of R-R intervals (the distances between two R-peaks). This research aims to incorporate the  
transition matrix as a novel measure of R-R variability, while combining three segmentation schemes  
and two feature importance measures to systematically analyze the significance of individual features.  
The MIT-BIH dataset was first divided into three segmentation schemes, consisting of 5-s, 10-s, and  
25-s subsets. In total, 21 various features, including the transition matrix features, were extracted  
from these subsets and used for the training of 11 machine learning classifiers. Permutation  
importance and tree-based feature importance were calculated to determine the most predictive features  
for each model.

### [Classifying violent anti-government conflicts in Mexico: A machine learning framework](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3580 "Classifying violent anti-government conflicts in Mexico: A machine learning framework")

Domestic crime, conflict, and instability pose a significant threat to modern governments, especially evident in Mexico. Existing efforts in predicting intrastate conflict lack comprehensive spatial and temporal correlations. In response, we propose a novel methodology leveraging machine learning to accurately classify future anti-government violence. Classical algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting classifier) are trained alongside CNN + LSTM networks to capture spatial and temporal relationships, surpassing deep learning models in performance. Shapley additive values identify key predictors, with the Voting classifier consistently outperforming alternatives, emphasizing its efficacy in classification. Random Forest feature importance highlights pivotal predictors, including homicides, accidents, material conflicts, and citizen sentiment. Spatial analysis reveals minimal global autocorrelation, localized conflict clusters, and superior performance of the Voting Classifier over GPBoost, suggesting limited spatial dependency. This methodology provides interpretable results crucial for informed decision-making and enabling effective resource allocation deftly

### [Distributionally Robust Machine Learning with Multi-source Data](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3582 "Distributionally Robust Machine Learning with Multi-source Data")

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28989318/

Empirical risk minimization may lead to poor prediction performance when the target distribution differs from the source populations. This paper utilizes data from multiple sources and introduces a group distributionally robust prediction model defined to optimize an adversarial reward about explained variance with respect to a class of target distributions. We show that our group distributionally robust prediction model is a weighted average of the source populations' conditional outcome models. We leverage this identification result to robustify arbitrary machine learning algorithms, including, for example, random forests and neural networks. We devise a novel bias-corrected estimator to estimate the optimal aggregation weight for general machine-learning algorithms and demonstrate its improvement in the convergence rate. Our proposal can be seen as a distributionally robust federated learning approach that is computationally efficient and easy to implement using arbitrary machine learning base algorithms, satisfies some privacy constraints, and has a nice interpretation of different sources' importance for predicting a given target covariate distribution.

### [Electrodermal activity based on-device machine learning for multidimensional substance use data stre](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3583 "Electrodermal activity based on-device machine learning for multidimensional substance use data stre")

Popularity of wearable devices prompts growth of on-device machine learning methods, however, computational efficiency thereof is underresearched for substance use detection. Electrodermal Activity (EDA) patterns are not yet clarified as a valid biophysiological proxy in substance use detection. Herein, an EDA based on-device machine-learning algorithm is developed to fully utilize clarified EDA patterns to detect cocaine use in biosensor data streams. Adaptive peak detection for EDA-involved data streams is enabled by optimizing thresholds tuned with a skin temperature-adaptive slide window. Three categories of cocaine users and therefrom derived simulated data are evaluated: 1) urine-verified and self-reported; 2) only urine-verified; and 3) self-reported and our algorithm detected positive. Our method outperforms other deep learning methods in detection speed when tested on emulated real-time transmitted data streams while having similar or better accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Our method could enable on-device EDA-involved cocaine use detection and be broadly tailored to other EDA-related substance use detection for multi-dimensional biosensor streams.

### [Feasibility of Monitoring Nocturnal Tonic Seizures with Wearable Devices and Machine Learning](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3585 "Feasibility of Monitoring Nocturnal Tonic Seizures with Wearable Devices and Machine Learning")



Nocturnal seizure detection is a significant challenge in the field of neurology as seizures are often unreported by patients and caregivers. This study assessed whether nocturnal tonic seizure semiology could be identified using a machine learning (ML) model trained on wrist-worn device data. The study utilized Empatica E4 devices on four participants, monitoring accelerometry, electrodermal activity, blood volume pulse, skin temperature, and heart rate. Seizure onset was annotated by clinical video-EEG during in-hospital monitoring. A total of 10 nocturnal tonic seizures were collected. RandOM Convolutional KErnal Transform (ROCKET) models were employed using a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation scheme. Model performance was evaluated using seizure-level epoch statistics. All participants were male with a median age of 19 (IQR: 17-21). Our highest performing model achieved an AUROC: 0.95; Average Precision: 0.79; Recall: 0.91; and False Positive Rate: 0.004. These preliminary results suggest the potential utility of wrist-worn device data and ML in reliably identifying nocturnal tonic seizures, offering promise for detecting broader manifestations such as FBDS.

### [Learning to Localize: Practical Algorithms for Online Weighted Conformal Prediction](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3586 "Learning to Localize: Practical Algorithms for Online Weighted Conformal Prediction")

We propose a method for performing uncertainty quantification with guarantees in online settings with arbitrary distribution shifts by leveraging the framework of weighted conformal prediction. Previous work on conformal prediction in the online adversarial setting focus on achieving marginal coverage under the assumption of full feedback (i.e., labels are observed every time step); we go beyond this goal and additionally aim for good local coverage and coverage under intermittent feedback (i.e., labels for some time steps are never observed). The key idea of our method is to define a localizer that assigns weights to calibration examples that are decreasing in their distance to the test point (measured in an embedded space), then adaptively adjust the localizer bandwidth as we observe feedback. This yields an assumption-free guarantee of marginal coverage while also displaying strong local coverage, even under intermittent feedback, when distribution shifts are less adversarial. We validate our method empirically on several synthetic and real datasets.

### [Multiple-Output Composite Quantile Regression Through an Optimal Transport Lens](https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=3922 "Multiple-Output Composite Quantile Regression Through an Optimal Transport Lens")

Composite quantile regression has been used to obtain robust estimators of regression coefficients in linear models with good statistical efficiency. By reveavling an intrinsic link between the composite quantile regression loss function and the Wasserstein distance from the residuals to the set of quantiles, we establish a generalization of the composite quantile regression to the multiple-output settings. Theoretical convergence rates of the proposed estimator are derived both under the setting where the additive error possesses only a finite l-th moment (for l > 2) and where it exhibits a sub-Weibull tail. In doing so, we develop novel techniques for analysing M-estimation problem that involves Wasserstein-distance in the loss. Numerical studies confirm the practical effectiveness of our proposed procedure.
